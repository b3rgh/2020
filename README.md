# 2020

2020 is a personal tech trend report, created at the turn of the decade. I bundled my thoughts and feelings regarding technology in society today, reflecting on possible ways forward. I ended up with a coloring book of twelve smart technologies; twelve cameras; twelve concerns.

This colouring book is about freedom, love, and futures.

The tension between the naive form of a colouring book and its harsh content – references below – embodies my own view on tech. As engineer, academic, designer, maker, user, person, partner, parent, and friend; I feel conflicted about the state of things in 2020. With this colouring book, I point at the split between form – as ways of being presented – and content – as technical implementations – of these twelve technolgies. But for now, let's stick to what is possible—to freedom, love, and futures.

All my wishes, hopes, and dreams; may 2020 be gentle.
